What lies ahead, is anyone's guess...

This project is a test-case for taking a zork-like text adventure engine and porting it to onchain gaming engines and frameworks like MUD and Dojo, and from there seeing if interesting interoperability between the engines can be connected and experimented with.

This will be piloted by a text adventure aclled the O'ruggin Trail.

WARNING: attempting a crossing to the frontiers of crypto country ultimately always results in horrible death... physical, moral, ego, or otherwise.

Pre death you'll want to run `pnpm install` at the root 
of this repo because we aren't checking in the node_modules folder.
cruft....

**Really**. Run `pnpm install` at the project root. Or be dead. Pfft.
